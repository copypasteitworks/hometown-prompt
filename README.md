## Requirements

- Zsh

## Installation

Shell plugin manager is the recommended installation method.

### With a shell plugin manager

1. Install hometown-prompt with a zsh plugin manager. Each has their own way of doing things. See your package manager's documentation or the [zsh plugin manager plugin installation procedures gist](https://gist.github.com/olets/06009589d7887617e061481e22cf5a4a).

    After adding the plugin to the manager, restart zsh:

    ```shell
    exec zsh
    ```

### Manual

Either clone this repo and add `source path/to/hometown-prompt.zsh` to your `.zshrc`, or

1. Download [the latest `hometown-prompt` binary](https://github.com/olets/hometown-prompt/releases/latest)
1. Put the file `hometown-prompt` in a directory in your `PATH`

Then restart zsh:

```shell
exec zsh
```

## Usage

Once installed, open a new terminal. The theme will be Hometown!

### Examples

Try out Hometown at https://git-prompt-kit.netlify.app/.

Conceptually it is

```
<time> <CWD and parent> <branch or commit> <commits ahead> <commits behind> <upstream (branch if different name, remote and branch if not default remote, "local" if none)> <tag>
<stashes> <assumed-unchanged files> <skip-worktree files> <untracked files> <conflicted files> <deleted files> <modified files> <new files> <staged deleted files> <staged modified files> <action>
```

The `<CWD and parent>` segment can be replaced with any arbitrary content (see [Options](#options)).

In the above screenshot, the theme shows that

- `main` is checked out and dirty
- it is one commit ahead of the remote tracking branch
- there are three stashes, no untracked files, no conflicted files, no unstaged deleted files, one unstaged modified file, no staged new files, no staged deleted files, and one staged modified file
- the previous command succeeded, and that the user is not root
- and, implicitly, that
    - neither the user or host is unexpected,
    - the remote tracking branch is `origin/main`
    - the local branch is not behind it
    - there is no tag at `HEAD`
    - there are no files with the assume-unchanged bit set
    - there are no files with the skip-worktree bit set
    - and there is no action (e.g. merge, rebase, cherry-pick) underway.

### Options

Hometown uses Git Prompt Kit. See [Git Prompt Kit's Options](https://github.com/olets/git-prompt-kit#options) for the many customizations available.
